Using Visual Studio, bootstrap, HTML, CSS we created a very dynamic and responsive Game Review website that offers a marketplace to purchase merchandise.
This was a group project but as you can see in the commits I was responsible for:
The basket/store functionality,
The ability to add/delete/edit reviews & product items,
Login/Registering of users,
The ability for moderators & admins to have seperate functionality to regular users (an admin can create moderators and add stock, a moderator can add/edit/delete reviews).
